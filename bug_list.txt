Bug List
--------

1. Arrow to/from an arrow does not work on arrow shape but instead bounding rect of the arrow, so it doesn't look right when
  the angle of the arrow is at 45 degrees wrt a screen edge.
  
2. Bug where mouse sometimes sticks to control points and won't release the control point.

3. Arrows at a significant diagonal do not point toward center of node.  

4. When label is freed from parent box it also appears unbounded by grandparent box.
  This resulted from another related bugfix, so we have to correct this probably
  by adding another shape/box type.
